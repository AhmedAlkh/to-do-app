## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- CSS cube methodologies
- Npm scripts
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- In this project I learned about SCSS! It is a great way to organize your CSS files and seeing the errors pop up with live server was great. I also learned the importance of creating variables for your app/websites color for when it's time to make a change or scale the project. I learned a lot about JavaScript in this project and got to gain hands on experience with the help and patience of my partner in this project, Daniel. This project really helped me understand the importance of clean code and organization and I plan to improve on it heavily.
